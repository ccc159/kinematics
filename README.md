### kinematics

This javascript library is written based on [KinematikJava](http://labaaa.org/kinematikjava/), which includes:

1. Translations between three different representations of frame (coordinate system): XYZABC (coordinates and Euler angles), homogenous matrix, and axes (x-axis and a point on XY plane).

2. Frame attachment and inverse

3. Forward kinematics

4. Inverse kinematics
